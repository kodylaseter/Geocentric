    Group Component
    Basic Physics Interaction: main character has a rigid body along with many other objects in the game, causing collision along with other events depending on the colliding object.
    Collider Animation: main character has a collider that changes shape when he jumps.
    Ragdoll Simulation: pressing the backspace key makes our main character ragdoll, although there are some known bugs with this.
    Game Feel: our game controls are responsive and characters have a personality.

    We made some of our assets using Blender, Adobe Photoshop, and music synthesising software.

Within Assets/Music/SoundEffects: contents in PianoFootsteps/ and LowXylaphoneFootsteps/ are all hand made.
