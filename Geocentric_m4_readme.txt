UI Components
1. Introduction menu scene: title of game, team name, start button, credits
2. Background of menu must be visually appealing and animated
3. Menu items should be well positioned/styled (readable text, no weird overlapping), elements should be customized for your game (do not use default UI selections for font. Create custom button image for clickable elemnts of interface & document your reasoning for design)
4. Menu system should be navigable with controller/keyboard in addition to normal mouse clicking: highlighting, able to go up/down left/right, loop through list
5. Credits of game: document all devs on team & their majors, document 3rd party content you used
6. Credits must be visually compelling

Particles
7. At least 2 different particle effects, each needs to be 2 different particle systems. Choose appropriate shape for spawning them
8. In one particle effect, leverage changing SIZE of particles with one of the modules, particles must change size during the life of the particle, not just a curve of start size.
	Ben's level: Secondary "splashes" on the floor produce particles that shrink over their lifespan
9. In one particle effect, leverage changing SPEED of particles
10. In one particle effect, leverage a 2D custom material
	Ben's level: "Meteor shower" uses custom star texture
11. In one particle effect, leverage sub-emitters.
	Ben's level: "Meteor shower" "splashes" on the floor, producing a burst from a secondary (sub) emitter  
12. Trigger one particle effect based on events in game.
	Ben's level: Player collides with "star" goal platforms and they emit a burst of defaults
